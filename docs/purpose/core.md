# Highlyreco: Purpose & Vision

## Why This Exists

I have ADHD. And I genuinely love and hate YouTube.

YouTube made it possible for me to learn things that were otherwise impossible. How to fix my car. How to code in a new language. How to understand complex topics that no book explained well. I've learned so much from YouTube that I can't imagine my life without it.

But I also can't escape it.

The welcome page. The infinite scroll. The "up next" autoplay. These aren't bugs—they're features designed to hijack my attention. And for someone with ADHD, cheap dopamine isn't just annoying. It's devastating.

Here's my trap: I need YouTube for work. I can't fully block it. But every time I open it to learn something specific, I inevitably fall down the rabbit hole. Two hours later, I've watched fifteen videos and accomplished nothing. The platform I need is also the platform that exploits me.

Then something changed. I started using LLMs.

A blank chat box. No recommendations. No "you might also like." No infinite scroll. Just a cursor waiting for my question.

And it still solved my learning problem. Better, actually—because there were no distractions.

That's when I realized: the recommendation algorithm isn't the only way. It's just the most profitable way for platforms that sell attention.

## The Problem

Every major platform has the same business model: capture attention, sell it to advertisers.

This creates a fundamental misalignment. The platform profits when you scroll longer, not when you find what you need. The algorithm optimizes for engagement, not value. Your time is the product.

The result:
- **Infinite scroll** designed to eliminate stopping points
- **Autoplay** that removes the need for intentional choice
- **Recommendation algorithms** that serve what's addictive, not what's useful
- **Notification systems** engineered to pull you back in
- **Content overload** with no meaningful filter

There's so much content on the internet now that no human could consume even a fraction of it. We need filters. But the filters we have—algorithms—are designed to benefit the platform, not us.

## The Insight

We already have a better recommendation system. We just don't use it online.

Think about how you actually make decisions:

- When I need a car recommendation, I ask my friend who's a motorhead. He lives and breathes cars. I trust his judgment completely.
- When I need a laptop, I ask my geeky friend who researches every spec. He's not the car guy. Different expertise.
- When I want a restaurant in a new city, I ask the friend who travels and actually cares about food.

We intuitively know who to trust for what. We have mental maps of expertise in our networks. Your car expert friend is not your laptop expert friend is not your restaurant friend.

This is a recommendation engine based on people you know. On trust. On expertise you can evaluate because you know the person.

The other insight came from LLMs. They proved that you can have an incredibly useful tool without a recommendation engine. A blank interface that waits for your intent. No manipulation. No addiction loops.

What if we built a social platform that worked the same way?

## What Highlyreco Is

Highlyreco is a social platform where people post recommendations. That's it.

Not status updates. Not life highlights. Not engagement bait. Just: "Here's something I think is worth your attention, and here's why."

**It's people-centered, not algorithm-centered.**

You follow people whose taste and expertise you trust. Your feed is simply what they recommend, in chronological order. No algorithm deciding what you should see. No optimization for engagement.

**You can recommend anything.**

- A restaurant that changed how you think about food
- An npm package that saved you hours of work
- A book that shifted your perspective
- A YouTube video that's actually worth watching
- A product that solved a problem you didn't know you had
- A podcast episode, an article, a tool, a place

The scope is unlimited because human expertise is unlimited.

**It's intentional discovery, not addictive scrolling.**

You come to Highlyreco with a purpose: "I need a laptop recommendation from someone who knows laptops." You find the person, see their recommendations, make your decision, and leave.

There's no infinite scroll. No autoplay. No "you might also like." The platform is designed to be useful, not addictive.

## Core Principles

### What We Build

1. **Trust over algorithms** — Your feed is people you chose to follow, nothing more
2. **Intention over engagement** — Design for users who come with purpose and leave satisfied
3. **Quality over quantity** — A single great recommendation beats a thousand mediocre ones
4. **Transparency over manipulation** — Users always know why they're seeing something
5. **Respect over exploitation** — User attention is sacred, not a resource to extract

### What We Will Never Do

1. **No infinite scroll** — Clear beginnings and endings
2. **No algorithmic recommendations** — Only human curation
3. **No engagement optimization** — We don't measure success by time-on-site
4. **No autoplay** — Every action is intentional
5. **No dark patterns** — No tricks to keep you longer than you want
6. **No selling attention** — Our business model doesn't depend on addiction

## The Economics: Why This Works

Something fundamental is changing in the economy.

**Creation is becoming cheap.** LLMs and AI tools mean anyone can create content, products, code. The barrier to making things has collapsed.

**Discovery is becoming expensive.** When everyone can create, the hard part is being found. Marketing and SEO become more competitive and costly.

This creates an opportunity for a different model:

### Three-Way Value Creation

| Who | What They Get |
|-----|---------------|
| **Creators** | Focus on making great stuff. Let trusted recommenders handle discovery. Pay for results, not reach. |
| **Recommenders** | Monetize your expertise and taste. Earn when your recommendations actually help people. |
| **Consumers** | Find quality through people you trust. Skip the noise. Save time and attention. |

### Our Revenue Model: Transparent Affiliate Links

Recommenders can earn money when their recommendations lead to purchases. This aligns incentives correctly:

- You only make money when your recommendation is *actually useful* (someone buys it)
- No incentive to recommend garbage for engagement
- Creators don't pay for exposure—they pay for results
- Full transparency: users always know when a link is affiliated

This is a **trust-based discovery marketplace**, not an attention marketplace.

## Who This Is For

**People with expertise to share**
You know things. You've spent years developing taste in some domain. Your recommendations are valuable, and you want a place to share them where they won't get lost in algorithmic noise.

**People seeking recommendations from trusted sources**
You don't want to become a car expert or a laptop expert—but you still want to buy the right car and the right laptop. You want access to expertise through people you trust.

**Anyone exhausted by algorithmic manipulation**
You're tired of platforms that treat your attention as a resource to exploit. You want tools that respect your time and serve your interests, not their engagement metrics.

**People with ADHD or attention challenges**
Cheap dopamine and infinite scroll aren't just annoying—they're destructive. You need platforms designed for intentional use, not addiction.

## The Future We're Building

A world where:

- Discovery happens through trust, not manipulation
- Experts can monetize their knowledge without becoming content creators
- Consumers can access expertise without falling down rabbit holes
- Platforms respect attention instead of exploiting it
- Social media helps you find what you need and then lets you go

This is what Highlyreco is about.

Not another attention trap. A tool that actually serves you.
