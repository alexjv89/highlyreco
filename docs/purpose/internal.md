# Highlyreco: Internal North Star

*This document is for the founding team. It's the manifesto we return to when making hard decisions.*

## Our Origin

This project exists because I couldn't stop watching YouTube when I should have been working.

I have ADHD. Infinite scroll and cheap dopamine aren't minor annoyances for me—they're a constant battle. And I lost that battle more times than I can count.

The cruel irony: I *need* YouTube. It's genuinely one of the best learning tools ever created. But I can't use it without getting exploited by it.

When I started using LLMs, I noticed something. A blank chat box. No recommendations. No algorithm pulling me in directions I didn't choose. Just a tool that waited for my intent and served it.

That's when it clicked: the addictive parts aren't necessary. They're just profitable.

Highlyreco is the platform I wish existed. One that respects my attention instead of exploiting it.

## What We Believe

### 1. Attention is sacred

Every minute of someone's attention is a minute of their life. We don't get to waste it. We don't get to steal it. We don't get to trick them into giving more than they intended.

If a user opens Highlyreco, finds what they need, and leaves in two minutes—that's a success. Not a failure to engage.

### 2. Trust beats algorithms

Algorithms optimize for engagement. Humans optimize for what actually matters to them.

A recommendation from someone you trust—who has expertise you can evaluate because you know them—is worth more than a thousand algorithmically-surfaced suggestions.

### 3. Intentional use is the goal

We're not building a place to "hang out" or "kill time." We're building a tool. You come with a purpose, you accomplish it, you leave.

This is the opposite of every other social platform. And that's the point.

### 4. Creation is cheap, discovery is valuable

AI is making it trivial to create content. The scarce resource now is finding what's actually worth your time.

We're building infrastructure for trust-based discovery. That's valuable. That's defensible. That's what the world needs.

## Red Lines: What We Will Never Do

These aren't negotiable. They're not "until we have enough users." They're permanent.

### Never: Infinite scroll
There will always be a clear end. You've seen everything from people you follow. You're done. Go live your life.

### Never: Algorithmic recommendations
Your feed is exactly what you asked for: recommendations from people you chose to follow. We don't insert "you might also like" or "trending" or "suggested for you." Ever.

### Never: Engagement optimization
We don't measure success by time-on-site, session length, or return visits. These metrics optimize for addiction. We refuse to track them as KPIs.

### Never: Dark patterns
No guilt trips for leaving. No fake urgency. No notification manipulation. No buried unsubscribe buttons. No tricks.

### Never: Selling attention to advertisers
Our revenue comes from facilitating valuable transactions (affiliate), not from selling eyeballs. The moment we sell attention, our incentives corrupt.

### Never: Growth hacks that compromise trust
No buying fake users. No engagement bait. No viral loops that trick people into spamming friends. Growth must be organic and earned.

## Decision Framework

When we're stuck on a product decision, ask these questions in order:

### 1. Does this respect user attention?
If a feature might waste someone's time or trick them into spending more time than intended, we don't build it.

### 2. Does this increase trust or decrease it?
Features that make the platform more trustworthy: yes. Features that introduce noise, manipulation, or uncertainty: no.

### 3. Does this serve user intent or platform metrics?
We build for what users came to do, not for what makes our graphs go up.

### 4. Would I want this if I were the user with ADHD?
The founder has ADHD. Every feature should pass the test: would this be safe and useful for someone who struggles with attention?

## Success Metrics (What We Actually Track)

### Track:
- **Task completion rate**: Did users find what they were looking for?
- **Recommendation quality**: Do people act on recommendations? Are they satisfied?
- **Trust indicators**: Do users return? Do they follow more people? Do they recommend us to friends?
- **Creator success**: Are recommenders building audiences? Are they earning from affiliate?

### Don't track (as KPIs):
- Time on site
- Session length
- Daily active users (vanity)
- Engagement rate
- Scroll depth

If we catch ourselves optimizing for engagement metrics, we've lost the plot.

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### We might grow slower
Addictive features drive growth. We're choosing not to use them. That means we might grow slower than competitors who do. That's okay. We'd rather have fewer users who trust us than more users we're exploiting.

### We might make less money per user
Attention-harvesting is lucrative. Our model is different. We make money when recommendations lead to valuable transactions, not when users scroll mindlessly. Revenue per user might be lower. That's okay.

### Some users won't get it
People conditioned by algorithmic feeds might find Highlyreco "boring." No infinite content! You actually run out of things to see! Good. Those aren't our users. Our users are exhausted by the alternative.

### We might fail
Building an ethical social platform is hard. The economics favor exploitation. We might not make it work. But if we succeed by becoming what we hate, we've failed anyway.

## Reminders for Hard Days

When it's tempting to add "just a little" engagement optimization:
> Remember how it feels to lose two hours to YouTube when you meant to watch one video. That's what you'd be building.

When growth is slow and competitors are racing ahead:
> They're growing by exploiting attention. We're growing by earning trust. Trust compounds. Exploitation eventually collapses.

When investors push for engagement metrics:
> The right investors understand our model. The wrong investors will destroy what we're building. Choose carefully.

When users ask for algorithmic recommendations:
> They've been conditioned to want them. Our job is to show them something better, not to give them more of what's harming them.

## The World We're Building Toward

- Discovery through trust, not manipulation
- Platforms that respect attention
- Experts who can share knowledge without becoming engagement machines
- Users who find what they need and get on with their lives
- Social media that makes life better, not worse

This is worth building. This is worth the slower growth and harder economics.

Let's not forget why we started.
