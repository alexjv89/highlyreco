# Highlyreco: Find Your Next Favorite Thing Through People You Trust

---

## The Problem You Know Too Well

You open YouTube to learn one thing. Two hours later, you've watched fifteen videos and can't remember why you came.

You scroll Instagram looking for inspiration. An hour disappears. You feel worse than when you started.

You need a product recommendation. You Google it, wade through sponsored results and fake reviews, and still don't know what to buy.

**The platforms designed to help you discover things are actually designed to trap you.**

Infinite scroll. Autoplay. "Recommended for you." These features exist to keep you watching, not to help you find what you need.

There's so much content online that no one could watch it all. You need a filter. But the algorithms filtering for you optimize for engagement—not for what's actually valuable to *you*.

## A Better Way to Discover

Think about how you actually make decisions in real life.

When you need a car recommendation, you don't Google "best cars 2024." You ask your friend who's obsessed with cars. The one who's researched every model and can tell you exactly what fits your needs.

When you need a laptop, you ask your techie friend. When you want a restaurant, you ask the friend who actually cares about food.

**You already have a recommendation engine. It's called people you trust.**

We all have mental maps of who knows what. Your car friend isn't your laptop friend isn't your restaurant friend. You know whose expertise to trust in each domain.

Highlyreco brings this online.

## What Highlyreco Is

**A social platform where people share recommendations. That's it.**

Not status updates. Not life highlights. Not engagement bait. Just: "Here's something I think is worth your attention, and here's why."

### Follow People, Not Algorithms

You choose who to follow based on their expertise and taste. Your feed shows their recommendations in chronological order. No algorithm decides what you see.

### Recommend Anything

Books, products, restaurants, articles, podcasts, videos, tools, npm packages, places to visit—whatever you're an expert in or passionate about.

### Come With Purpose, Leave Satisfied

Highlyreco isn't designed to trap you. There's no infinite scroll. You see recommendations from people you follow, you find what you need, you leave. That's success.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Find People Whose Taste You Trust

Search by topic, browse curators, or follow friends. Find the people who know what they're talking about in areas you care about.

### 2. See Their Recommendations

A simple feed of what they recommend. No algorithm manipulation. Just honest recommendations from people you chose to follow.

### 3. Discover Through Trust

When someone you trust recommends something, it carries weight. You're not filtering through sponsored content or fake reviews—you're getting real recommendations from real people.

### 4. Share Your Own Expertise

You know things other people don't. You've developed taste and expertise in some area. Share your recommendations and help others discover what's worth their time.
